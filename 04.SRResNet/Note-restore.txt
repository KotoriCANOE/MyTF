TODO:
modify SE to be local adaptive



original resize, multi=3

1000	patch=96 batch=16
1001	patch=64 batch=16

add artifacts resize (ringing & aliasing), multi=2

1002

remove SE activation since it will cause discontinuity between patches, and is actually not viable for large patch by utilizing global average for features
use random scaling ratio
reduce strength of artifacts resize

1003	use_se=0, predown=True
1004	use_se=1, predown=False

added local average SE activation (use_se=2)
use symmetric kernel for Gauss filter in SSIM
predown=False

1005	use_se=2
1006	use_se=0

slightly modified weights of random resizes, remove artifacts resize

1007 use_se=1, channels=64, g_depth=8, patch=96

use_se=1, channels=64, g_depth=8, patch=96
limit random scaling to be >= 4/3
use different weights for downscale/upscale

1008

patch=112
force scaling at least 1 stage (2 scales)

1009

lower prob. of multistage from 0.5 to 0.3
slightly modified weights, use artifacts resize in upscale

1010

added random chroma downsampling to JPEG compression
prob. of JPEG from 0.32 to 0.40
slightly modified weights

1011

added random chroma downsampling
prob. of JPEG = 0.32

1012	patch=112, g_depth=8, activation=su, channels=64
1013	patch=160, g_depth=8, activation=su, channels=32
1014*	patch=160, g_depth=8, activation=swish, channels=32
1015	patch=160, g_depth=5, activation=su, channels=32
1016*	patch=128, g_depth=16, activation=swish, channels=32
